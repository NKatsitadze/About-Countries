# About-Countries

My first asynchronous project, where we use restcountries API
to receive information about specific countries.
Also, I used Geolocation API, so simply by clicking a button,
Geolocation finds client's location and asks restcountries to 
send over info about this specific country, where the client is.

P.s I did not use Async/await functions, because I just wanted to 
work with promises manually.

Optimized for every screen size and browser, just allow location
services, if you want the app to find your country.
